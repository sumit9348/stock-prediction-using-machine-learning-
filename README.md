PROBLEM:-
HERE I HAVE DEVELOPED A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TO PREDICT THE STOCK PRICE

OBJECTIVE:-
1.Creating a Facebook Prophet Model & Forecasting the stock price of Tesla 30 days into the future

2.Data Visualization using Plotly express

3.Stock Analysis & Forecast evaluation using Google Finance in Google Sheets 

WHY FACEBOOK PROPHET:-
It is open for collaboration, and people are free to make pull requests to improve it further. One major advantage with Prophet is that it does not require much prior knowledge of forecasting time series data as it can automatically find seasonal trends with a set of data and offers easy to understand parameters.
